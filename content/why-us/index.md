    - heading: People
      desc: We hire better, and we train better. We prefer to recruit through our network and always vet our IT pros to ensure suitability for global work. Our unique employee training methods and mixed-team setup produce high-performing, cross-cultural teams.
    - heading: Global Thinking, Local Prices
      desc: What is now Synergy started as a team extension for a Danish company, so the Western mindset is part of our DNA. Being based in Pakistan, however, allows us to keep costs at an extremely competitive level.  
    - heading: Scalability
      desc: We have the structure and processes in place to scale up and down quickly. Our large talent pool supports rapid growth, while the range and variety of clients and projects we take on ensure long-term stability.

  title: "Common Concerns About Offshoring"
  para1: "We need to work closely with our developers and that requires intimate understanding of our business and culture."
  para2: "Our IT systems and data are vital to us, we can’t gamble with quality."
  para3: "We are too small for offshoring to be a feasible solution."
  para4: "Offshoring companies are notorious for high staff turnover—and we end up paying for that."
  para5: "We can’t risk losing control of our IT development."

concernsright:
  title: "How We Address That"
  para1: "We train our teams extensively on any new client’s business and culture—we even train our clients on how to work best with us. "
  para2: "We hire only highly educated and experienced engineers, and our project management is second to none. "
  para3: "Scalability to the rescue. We can accommodate clients and projects of all sizes, whether you need one person for a week or 15 people for a year."
  para4: "Synergy team members stay for the long haul. Our churn rate is far lower than for IT professionals in most Western countries."
  para5: "You won’t. We work as an integrated part of your team, not as a distant vendor."  

howwework:
    - lead: "Let’s be honest. Traditional offshoring has a poor reputation and for good reason."
      normal: "Problems abound: communication breakdowns, high churn rates, quality issues, and cultural differences. At the same time, companies everywhere strain under the escalating costs and pressure of continual innovation."
    - lead: "What’s the answer?"
      normal: "Reengineer offshoring. Using our deep experience in IT development, team and systems setup, and overcoming cross-cultural challenges, we built a new collaboration model. One that works."

collabmodel:
  - lead: "Training:"
    normal: "Developing skills in cross-disciplinary areas like project management, testing, and documentation is just the beginning. Our team members also study problem solving and decision making processes, as well as their clients’ business, market, and culture."
    imgurl: "/img/graph.svg"
  - lead: "Culture:"
    normal: " For cross-border collaboration to succeed, you first have to map cultural differences, then train both sides to work together. Using the Hofstede Dimensions of National Culture framework, we address differences in open, constructive ways."
    imgurl: "/img/globe.svg"
  - lead: "Relationships:"
    normal: "Cross-functional teams, frequent interactions, and candid communication build relationships and active engagement of team members in both locations. We have regular virtual joint workshops and, whenever possible, arrange remote site visits."
